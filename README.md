# Spades & Spells

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Spades & Spells, an ecommerce website dedicated to selling card and board games.

## About

Spades & Spells caters to both casual players and dedicated gamers. Our catalogue includes classic games like Uno, Cluedo, and Monopoly, as well as games for a more gamer-based audience like Pokemon, Dungeons & Dragons, and more.

## Local Development

To work on the project locally, clone the repository and open any of the HTML files (to browse/test). Please note that SQL will not work locally because it requires an internet connection to establish the database, as it's on a hosted PHPMyAdmin platform.

## Online Browsing

Feel free to browse the website online with working SQL at: [Spades & Spells](https://spades-and-spells.infinityfreeapp.com/)

# PLEASE NOTE:

## SSL Certificate

When browsing online, you might encounter an alert message. The website has a valid SSL certificate. You can verify this by clicking on the page info button (button left of the URL in Chrome), then clicking on 'Connection is secure' > 'Certificate is valid'. This is a new Chrome feature where all pages need to be included in the SSL certificate, especially on the free hosting site I'm using. I only had the domain registered, but rest assured, it is safe to browse.
